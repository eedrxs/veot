# Veot

Veot is a decentralized polling platform built upon the Hedera Hashgraph. It harnesses blockchain technology to bring about a trustless, tamper-immune polling system that is free-for-all and serves as a competent tool for determining social outcomes and giving voice to opinions.

### Creating a poll

Creating a poll on the platform is as easy as it comes and there isn't much to elucidate on. If you intend creating a closed poll, the JSON document you'd upload should be in this format:

{
"accountIds": ["0.0.34142789", "0.0.34142790", "0.0.34142791"]
}

### Joining a poll

To join a poll, all you have to do is click on any one of the poll entries listed and its details will be displayed by the side, after which you can join if you're eligible.

You can also search for a specific poll using its poll ID.

### Voting

You can only vote once and only when the poll is ongoing.
